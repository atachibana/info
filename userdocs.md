# Data Privacy and your WordPress blog

WordPress now includes easy-to-use tools for site administrators to use to comply with better user data privacy. These tools make it easier for you to explain to your users what data you collect about them, why and how you collect it, what you do with that data and how they can request a copy or remove that information.

Based on national or international regulations (like the European Union's "General Data Protection Regulation) you may be required to have a "Privacy Policy" with disclosures explaining how your site works and what data it collects. As a result of these tools, you now have the opportunity to be more transparent about your website's practices to your users. 

Under some privacy laws, you may also be required to have your users' "explicit consent" before collecting their personal information, especially if it involves their name, email, birthdate, phone number or IP address. While WordPress.org does not yet have some of these tools built, [there are various plugins available](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tags/gdpr/) to help in collecting consent. Other plugins, especially in the case of forms, suggest that you add a "required" consent field that says something like [_"I consent to my submitted data being collected and stored"_](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wordpress-gravity-forms-and-gdpr-compliance/
) if this is a requirement for your website.

Every website is different and will have unique requirements on what to do to stay compliant with its users. Your policy will likely change as your website evolves, and it's important to keep it up-to-date based on how you are actually operating as a site. 

Further, just as new regulations (and clarity about existing ones) may continue to shift your requirements as a website, we strongly encourage you to consider that data privacy compliance is not a one-time responsibility. The best practice is to treat this new responsibility as a continuous goal, and we strongly encourage you to check these suggested guidelines and adjust your usage of these tools as needed. 

## Privacy Settings

This tool makes it easier to select and build a Privacy Policy page. A WordPress Admin can go to the mew menu page to manage Privacy settings by clicking on *Settings > Privacy*, Where the Privacy Policy page manager will be used. 

While you don't necessarily need to use this tool to build a Privacy Policy, we believe it is helpful because it provides sample text to help you in describing how your WordPress site works based on the efforts of the community. We've written a description of how data is collected by using a default WordPress site and also encouraged theme and plugin developers to take advantage of the "Privacy Policy Editing Helper," which will make it easier for you to get started in disclosing to your users about how you collect and use their data.


### Privacy Policy Editing Helper

The *Editing Helper* feature is part of the new *Privacy Settings* inside WordPress. Based on WordPress core and your site's themes/plugins, the Editing Helper pulls together a set of default text that will show you all of the potential features your WordPress site might use, generating a template that you can use to build a Privacy Policy.

While not all sites use WordPress may not enable comments on posts, nearly every site uses key features like login cookies, media uploads. Take the time read through this and understand what your site does and describe what a user should know. 

While this tool does give a sample policy for you to build on, It is expected that your Privacy Policy will shift from this template. It will probably not describe all the features your site uses, just the main usages that WordPress.org sites tend to collect and what how some of your themes and plugins may handle data. For example, many sites embed analytics scripts or email subscription services in ways the the Editing Helper tool isn't aware of, so the default template may not completely describe how your site might collect data about its user. If your default Privacy Policy page template does not include this, may need to add additional disclosures to describe to your users better about what your site does with their information.

In short, it is your responsibility to write a comprehensive privacy policy, to make sure it reflects all national and international legal requirements on privacy, and to keep your policy current and accurate. This tool gives you a head start on context to what data your WordPress site is probably collecting. 


## Export Personal Data tool
You'll find a feature to archive user data for export by clicking on _Tools > Export Personal Data_ in your WordPress dashboard. 

Similar to the "Erase Personal Data tool," this tool both manages email export requests by your users as well as allows you to gather a file bundle (`.zip` format) with information about that user and what data exists about them in your WordPress site.

### Please note:
- We strongly encourage you use the email validation feature built inside the privacy tools as confirmation will help prevent spoofing by nefarious users pretending to be someone they're not.
- While this tool's scope covers much of the scope of WordPress user data, it likely does not include information that may be collected by your site using a third party, such as an analytics provider, newsletter subscription service, ad affiliate partner or embedded media. 
- While the tool may give you a good start in giving your users what they've requested, every site owner should understand what data they collect so they can comply with any legal requests for export or erasure.

## Erase Personal Data tool
You'll find a feature to remove user data by clicking on _Tools > Erase Personal Data_ in your WordPress dashboard.  

Similar to the "Export Personal Data tool," this tool both manages email export requests by your users as well as allows you to gather a file bundle (`.zip` format) with information about that user and what data exists about them in your WordPress site.

### Please note: 
- We strongly encourage you use the email validation feature built inside the privacy tools as confirmation will help prevent spoofing by nefarious users pretending to be someone they're not.
- When using this tool: Erasure requests cannot be reversed after they have been confirmed. * Deleted data is deleted data.*
- When using this tool alongside automated backups, we urge you to exercise caution when restoring your "user" data from backups. When restoring an archived copy of your site, your requests for erasure should be respected.
- While this tool's scope covers much of the scope of WordPress user data, it likely does not include information that may be collected by your site using a third party, such as an analytics provider, newsletter subscription service, ad affiliate partner or embedded media. 
- While the tool may give you a good start in giving your users what they've requested, every site owner should understand what data they collect so they can comply with any legal requests for export or erasure.

Would be nice if we could add a "how-to-use" section - see Woo article here doing a good job:
