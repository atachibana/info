[sub of Privacy]

Every plugin that collects, uses or stores user related data should add a section of suggested text to the privacy policy postbox. This is best done with<code> wp_add_privacy_policy_content( $plugin_name, $policy_text )</code>. Then the site owners will be able to add the privacy information to their site's privacy policy.

To make this simpler for the users, the plugin that adds such text should try to arrange it in one or more of the following categories:
<ul>
 	<li>What personal data we collect and why we collect it
<ul>
 	<li>Their own manually input information</li>
 	<li>WP: Contact forms</li>
 	<li>WP: Comments</li>
 	<li>WP: Cookies</li>
 	<li>WP: Third party embeds</li>
 	<li>Analytics</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Who we share your data with</li>
 	<li>How long we retain your data</li>
 	<li>What rights you have over your data</li>
 	<li>Where we send your data</li>
 	<li>Your contact information</li>
 	<li>How we protect your data</li>
 	<li>What data breach procedures we have in place</li>
 	<li>What third parties we receive data from</li>
 	<li>What automated decision making and/or profiling we do with user data</li>
 	<li>Any industry regulatory disclosure requirements</li>
</ul>
